Vaadin + Spring-MVC + Spring-Boot
=================================

The project contains a sample to show how to run a vaadin application with multiple UIs in combination with the good old spring web mvc. The spring web sevlet uses Thymeleaf and templates to render the HTML output. It can be started simply as a standalone application that already contains its own web container. (Thanks to spring-boot, thas is long overdue!)
